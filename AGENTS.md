# AGENTS.md — rules for any AI agent editing this repo

This file is the contract any agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, …) must follow before touching code in `cursor-plugin-cc`. If you are human, read it too.

## What this repo is

A Claude Code plugin that delegates coding tasks from Claude to the Cursor CLI (`cursor-agent`). Thirteen slash commands under the `cursor:` namespace, a `cursor-runner` subagent, a `composer-prompting` skill, and a statusline widget. Source of truth lives under `plugins/cursor/`.

## Hard rules

1. **Zero runtime dependencies.** The plugin ships as plain ESM `.mjs` and must execute directly after `/plugin install` with zero `npm install` in the user's plugin cache. If you are about to add `execa`, `zod`, `nanoid`, a HTTP client, a command parser, or any other third-party runtime package — stop. Write a small inline helper instead. See `plugins/cursor/scripts/lib/run.mjs` as the reference pattern (it replaced `execa` in ~80 lines).
2. **No build step.** No TypeScript source, no bundler, no `dist/`. `scripts/*.mjs` IS the ship artefact. If you find yourself wanting one, something has gone wrong with the approach. (`npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --checkJs --noEmit` over the JSDoc annotations in `scripts/lib/` — that is a dev-time check like eslint, not a build step; `typescript` stays a devDependency.)
3. **Slash command scripts live under `plugins/cursor/scripts/<cmd>.mjs`.** Their wrappers at `plugins/cursor/commands/<cmd>.md` must use `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/<cmd>.mjs" -- "$ARGUMENTS"` with quoted `$ARGUMENTS` — unquoted breaks under zsh on any prompt containing `?`, `*`, or `@`. Exception: `review.md` and `adversarial-review.md` are model-orchestrated (they estimate the diff and ask wait-vs-background before running), so they give Claude the `node …` command in a fenced block rather than an auto-executing `!` line, and `adversarial-review` reuses `review.mjs --adversarial` instead of shipping its own script.
4. **`Bash(node:*)` is the only permission pattern used in `allowed-tools`.** Do not invent path-based patterns — Claude Code does not expand `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` inside `allowed-tools`. Exception: the two estimate-first review commands additionally list `Bash(git:*)`, `AskUserQuestion`, and `Read, Glob, Grep` for the size-estimate/ask step — those are tool-name patterns, not path-based ones, so they are fine.
5. **Jobs are persisted under `<state-root>/jobs/<repo-hash>/`.** Never break that layout; users point scripts at those files when reporting bugs. The state root resolves in `lib/paths.mjs#pluginHome`: `CURSOR_PLUGIN_CC_HOME` env → an existing `~/.cursor-plugin-cc` (legacy installs keep their history) → `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/state` (fresh installs) → `~/.cursor-plugin-cc`.
6. **Language: everything in this repo is English.** Code, comments, commit messages, docs, PR bodies, issue titles. The plugin does not impose a language policy on target repos — `cursor-runner` reads target-repo conventions — but this repo itself is English-only.
7. **Do not impose conventions on target repos.** The `cursor-runner` subagent reads `AGENTS.md` / `.cursor/rules` / existing code in whatever repo the user is working in and tells Cursor to match THAT style. When editing the subagent, do not hardcode English / Prettier / whatever.

## Task format

Every delegated task (whether you write it by hand or `/cursor:from-plan` generates it) uses five sections in this order:

1. **Goal** — one sentence.
2. **Repo context** — stack + pointer to AGENTS.md / `.cursor/rules` / conventions file.
3. **Acceptance criteria** — 1–5 verifiable bullets.
4. **Files to touch** — explicit list when predictable.
5. **How to verify** — exact commands (`npm test`, `task typecheck`, etc.).

Plus a **Constraints** block that forbids: touching files outside the list, renaming public APIs, modifying lockfiles.

## How to make a change

1. Branch named `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `refactor/…`, or `docs/…`.
2. Work inside `plugins/cursor/`. `cd plugins/cursor && npm install` installs dev deps (vitest, eslint, prettier, typescript — dev-time only).
3. Run tests: `npm test`. Run lint: `npm run lint`. Run types: `npm run typecheck`. All three must be green before committing.
4. Commit messages in conventional style (`type(scope): subject`).
5. Open a PR against `main` with a summary + test plan. CI must pass across Node 18.18 / 20 / 22 × Ubuntu / macOS.
6. Squash-merge only.

## Guardrails for automated edits

- Do not touch `package-lock.json` unless you are changing dependencies on purpose.
- Do not modify `~/.cursor-plugin-cc/jobs/**` — that is user state, never ours.
- Do not rename the command namespace (`cursor:`) or the marketplace name (`taher`) without explicit user approval — both are referenced in user environments.
- When adding a new slash command, follow the recipe in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Where things live

- `plugins/cursor/scripts/<cmd>.mjs` — command entrypoints (10; `adversarial-review` has no script of its own — it reuses `review.mjs --adversarial`). Two non-command scripts: `session-hook.mjs` (SessionStart/SessionEnd) and `stop-review-gate-hook.mjs` (Stop).
- `plugins/cursor/hooks/hooks.json` — Claude Code hook registration (session lifecycle + optional stop review gate).
- `plugins/cursor/prompts/*.md` — prompt templates (`{{UPPER_SNAKE}}` placeholders, loaded via `lib/prompts.mjs`). Edit prompts here, not as JS string arrays.
- `plugins/cursor/schemas/review-output.schema.json` — the structured-review contract; validated hand-rolled in `lib/review-output.mjs` (zero-deps — do not add a schema-validator package).
- `plugins/cursor/scripts/lib/*.mjs` — shared helpers (run, id, args, paths, jobs, kill, parse, cursor, git, invoked, plan, hints, md, prompts, config, review-output).
- `plugins/cursor/commands/*.md` — slash command wrappers.
- `plugins/cursor/scripts/statusline.mjs` — the Claude Code statusLine widget (not a slash command; wired by `/cursor:setup --install-statusline`).
- `plugins/cursor/scripts/lib/routing.mjs`, `groups.mjs`, `worktree.mjs`, `statusline-install.mjs` — per-type model routing (`.cursor-plugin-cc.json`), fanout group records, worktree bookkeeping, statusline settings wiring.
- `plugins/cursor/agents/cursor-runner.md` — the handoff subagent prompt.
- `plugins/cursor/skills/composer-prompting/` — Cursor prompt-shaping guidance the `cursor-runner` subagent references via its `skills:` frontmatter. `SKILL.md` is the always-loaded spine; the detailed material lives in `references/*.md` (prompt anatomy, model selection, anti-patterns), loaded on demand.
- `plugins/cursor/tests/*.test.mjs` — vitest specs + fixtures.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — what Claude Code's `/plugin install` reads.

If you are about to add a file outside these paths, justify it in the PR description.
